== Overview

RpcClient defines a common interface for method invocation that is to be implemented on all platform APIs. The purpose of the the common (language specific) interface is to allow the auto-generation of client-side & server-side code that is only language dependent (per uprotocol sdks) and not platform dependent. This benefit allows the reuse of the same autogenerated code to be used on multiple platforms. 

In this document we will elaborate on both the interface and implementation requirements. 

.API Definition Terminology
[width="80%",cols="20%,80%"]
|===
|Term | Description

| `IN` | Input parameter
| `OUT`| Output parameter
| `IN/OUT` | Input/output parameter
| `&` | Parameter passed by reference
| `Future` | Language specific mechanism to access the result of asynchronous operations, ex. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future[`std::future`] for C++, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[`CompletableFuture`] for Java, etc...

NOTE: For more details about the data model used in this interface, please refer to link:../ip-l1/README.adoc:_data_model[uP-L1 Data Model].

== Interface

 * Interface *MUST* be called `RpcClient`
 * *MUST* contain the method:

`OUT Futurelink:../ip-l1/README.adoc#_upayload[<UPayload>] invokeMethod(IN link:../basic/uuri.adoc[UUri], IN link:../ip-l1/README.adoc#_upayload[UPayload], IN link:../ip-l1/README.adoc#_uattributes[<UAttributes>])`


== Implementation

In the following section we shall elaborate on the implementation requirements for the RpcClient interface that *MUST* be implemented by all transports platform API libraries.

Implementation of RpcClient shall communicate with an underlining transport that is implemented through the link:../ip-l1/README.adoc#_utransport[uTransport Interface].

 * the topic and uAttributes passed to `invokeMethod()` *MUST* be cached non-persistent memory.

 * Method invocation that fails, *MUST* return exceptionally with per the link:../basics/error_model.adoc[uProtocol Error Model].

 * Cached requests must be completed exceptionally with  `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` when the `UAttributes.isExpired()` is true. This notifies the calling context that the request has expired.

 * *MUST* return `INVALID_PARAMETER` for the following errors:
  * `UUri` is null or empty
  * `UAttributes.type() != UMessageType.REQUEST`
  `UAttributesValidator.validate()` fails (i.e. one of the UAttributes is invalid per UAttributesValidator).

* *MUST* return `ALREADY_EXISTS` if the same request already exists (i.e. same `UUri` and `UAttributes`). This is to prevent duplicate requests.

* *MUST* complete future successfully when the response is received from the server.
