== Overview

https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a CNCF specification for describing events in a common way. We will use CloudEvents to formulate all kinds of uProtocol messages that will be sent to and from uEs.

CloudEvents are:

* An envelope for information about the occurrence of change in a system, it has a "from" address (source) with the "to" address is optional (sink)
* carry facts in metadata with standard attributes
* Self-contained & unique (you don't need to attach data to an event)
* Can be encoded/decoded into different formats without losing/modifying information

Cloud Events answers the following in the metadata:

* What kind of event?--> *type*
* When was it sent? --> *time*
* Who sent it? -->**source**
* What is the event unique identifier? --> *id*
* What is the shape of the data event? --> *dataschema*
* What is the event data? --> *data*

The specification is transport agnostic (can run over HTTP, MQTT, AMQP, NATS, Kafka), and comes with SDK in most common languages.

== CloudEvent Format vs Data Format

CloudEvents can be represented as objects (in the programming language of choice) as well as serialized to any binary or text encoding formats such as protobuf, JSON, AVRO, XML, etc.... CloudEvent are often referred to as "the envelope for data" as it holds the data and metadata.

https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] has defined a set of specifications for the well know formats (ex. https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md[JSON], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[Protobuf], etc..) as well as how to send these messages over well-known transports (ex. https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md[HTTP], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/mqtt-protocol-binding.md[MQTT], etc..).

NOTE: Additional formats and transports not covered by https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents.io] shall be covered in link:../up-l1/README.adoc[uP-L1 Specifications]
