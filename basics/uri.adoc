= URIs
:toc:
:sectnums:

The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*", "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14[IETF BCP14 (RFC2119 & RFC8174)]

URI is used as a method to uniquely identify uthings (devices, software entities, topics, methods, etc...). Defining a common URI for the system allows uEs to publish and discover each other as well as maintain a database/repository of microservices in the various vehicles.

== RFC3986

The standard URI format is defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986[RFC3986] and illustrated in the figure below.

.URI

URI specifications are covered at length in RFC3986 and will not be covered in this document, we will focus on the additions to RFC3986 that are specific to the uProtocol.

The following is taken from https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#appendix-A[RFC3986 Appendix-A] and shall be used as reference in this specification:

[source]
----
 gen-delims = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "\[" / "\]" / "@"
 sub-delims = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")"
 / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
 pchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"
 unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
 reserved = gen-delims / sub-delims

== uProtocol URI

.URI Specification
image::uri.drawio.svg[uProtocol URI Specification]

=== Long Form

.Long Form URI Description
[#long-form-uri]
[width="100%",cols="23%,18%,59%",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Value |Description

|`*up:*` |up: |Scheme (protocol name)
|*USERINFO* |pchar |User information
|*UDEVICE* |unreserved |Canonical hostname or IP address of the device following https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035[RFC1035] requirements.
|*UDOMAIN* | |Canonical domain name of the device following https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035[RFC1035] requirements.
|*PORT* |uint |The external port that the device streamer is listening on. Default **MAY **be 443
|*UE* |pchar |The name of the uE
|*UE_VERSION* |pchar a|
uE version  section.

If the URI is part of a topic:

* *MUST* only contain the MAJOR version number

|*METHOD* |pchar |Service rpc method name as defined in the service proto file, contains the prefix rpc. before the method name
|*RESOURCE* |pchar |A uThing that can be uniquely identified using a URI and manipulated/controlled by a service. Resources unique scope is when prepended with device and service to become a fully qualified URI. uThings that are not resources may be a service specific features, functionality, capabilities, etcâ€¦
|*MESSAGE* |*( pchar / "/" / "?" ) |Protobuf message name as defined in https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview.
|===


*Additional URI Protocol Rules:*

* *MAY* contain schema
* A segment in the path (UE_NAME, UE_VERSION, RESOURCE, METHOD) *MAY* be empty, resulting in two consecutive slashes (//) in the path component
* Schema and authority *MUST* be case-insensitive per RFC3986
* Path, query, and message *MUST* be case-sensitive

If a segment in the path is empty:

* The path *MUST NOT* start with "//"
* Path *MUST* be https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.3[path-abempty] (i.e. its value can be either an absolute path or empty)

=== Short Form
Short form URIs are used to represent various portions of the URI using IDs in lieu of strings. IDs in are declared in as metadata (Custom Options) in service protobufs.

.Short Form URI Descriptions
[#short-form-uri]
[width="100%",cols="23%,18%,59%",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Value |Description

|`*up:*` |up: |Scheme (protocol name)
|*USERINFO* |pchar |User information
|*UAUTHORITY* |unreserved | IP address (v4 ior v6) of the device
|*PORT* |uint
|The external port that the device streamer is listening on. Default **MAY **be 443
|*UE_ID* |pchar a|The unique identifier assigned to the uE.

* *MUST* be unique per feature/function in the network

|*UE_VERSION* |pchar a| uE version  section.

|*METHOD_ID \| TOPIC_ID* |*OPTIONAL* |uint
a| Method or topic Id from the protobuf file

* *MUST* be unique to the uE (method and topic IDs must not overlap)

|===

=== Fully Qualified URI
A URI long or short form URI containing all the items listed in either <<long-form-uri>> or <<short-form-uri>> tables depending on the URI format.

== Wildcards
The wildcard character `*` is used in certain circumstances in lieu of an item in the URI for matching any character or sequence of characters in a search.

== Example URIs

The section will give a few example URIs and their use in uProtocol. Service and resource will be generalized in this section. Example devices used for reference are http://bo.up.gm.com[bo.up.gm.com] representing the back office device, and VIN representing a vehicle.

When the authority is missing from the URI, it is considered a local URI.

.Example URIs
|===
|Use Case |Long Form |Short Form

|*publish* (source attribute)
|up://VCU.4Y1SL65848Z411439.veh.example.com/body.access/1/doors.front_left#Door
|up://192.168.1.100/4/1

|up://2001:cb0:fc::abc/0/

NOTE: Local URIs do not contain the authority (and begin with `/`)

.Query URIs
|===
| URI | Description

|up:/body.access/*/
|Reference latest version since version information is blank

|up:/body.access/[^1\|1}1.x\|1.*\|~1]
|Any version between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0
|up:/body.access/^1
|Resolve vehicle service from resource
