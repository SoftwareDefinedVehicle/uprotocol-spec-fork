The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*", "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14[IETF BCP14 (RFC2119 & RFC8174)]

== Overview 
URIs are used to uniquely identify (or address) stuff such as devices, software entities, topics, methods, etc...). A common URI definition allows _stuff_ to be addressable anywhere on any heterogeneous system.

=== RFC3986

The standard URI format is defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986[RFC3986] and illustrated in the figure below.

.URI
image::rfc3986.png[RFC3986 URI]

URI specifications are covered at length in RFC3986 and will not be covered in this document, we will focus on the additions to RFC3986 that are specific to the uProtocol.

The following is taken from https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#appendix-A[RFC3986 Appendix-A] and shall be used as reference in this specification:

 unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"
 reserved = gen-delims / sub-delims

<<uuri-specification>> diagram below provides an overview of the specifications that we will elaborate in this document. 

.URI Specification
[#uuri-specification]
image::uri.drawio.svg[uProtocol URI Specification]

A uProtocol URI can be represented in three formats:

1. <<UUri Data Model>>: A Language specific representation of a URI (i.e. class, structures, etc..)
2. <<Long Uris>>: UUri object serialized to a string containing names (i.e. human readable)
3. <<Micro Uris>>: UUri serialized to a byte array (i.e. machine readable). 

We shall elaborate on each format in this specification.


== UUri Data Model

UUri is a language specific representation of the uProtocol URI. This section shall explain the requirements for each SDK to implement such that the mental model is the same across all programming languages. <<UUri Data Model>> diagram below illustrates the UUri data model as well as includes the requirements for the naming convention for the various APIs.

.UUri Data Model
[#uuri-data-model]
image:uuri.drawio.svg[UUri Data Model]

 * *MUST* Follow the type names, member variables, and method names as defined in the diagram above

=== Uri Format

UriFormat is an interface that provide hints for what kind of information is in the belly of the Uri part or UUri itself such that the object can be serialized (represented) in long form, micro format, or both (resolved).

.UriFormat
[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
|API |Description

| `isLongForm(): boolean`
| Returns true if the Uri part contains names so that it can be serialized to <<Long Format>>

| `isEmpty(): boolean`
| Returns true if the object contains no information

| `isResolved(): boolean`
| Returns true if the object contains both names and numbers such that it can be serialize to both <<Long Format>> and <<Micro Formats>> 

| `isMicroForm(): boolean`
| Returns true if the Uri part contains the id's which will allow the Uri part to be serialized into <<Micro Formats>>

|===
  

=== UAuthority
`UAuthority` type is responsible for storing the uDevice and uDomain portion of the uProtocol URI.

 * Type name *MUST* be `UAuthority`
 * *MUST* contain `domain` and `device` member variables of type `std::string` with accessor methods of the same name to fetch each
 * *MUST* contain `address` member variable of type `InetAddress` with accessor method of the same name to fetch it
 * *MUST* be able to construct a `UAuthority` from a string
 * *MUST* support detection of local vs remote URIs from `UAuthority`
 * *MUST* contain helper functions to build well known UAuthority items (local, remote, etc...)

=== UEntity

`UEntity` type contains the uE id, name, and version portion of the uProtocol URI.

 * Type name *MUST* be `UEntity`
 * *MUST* contain `name` variable of type `std::string`, with accessor method of the same name to fetch the value
  * *MUST* contain `version` variable of type integer, with accessor method of the same name to fetch the value
 * *MUST* contain `id` member variable of type `uint16_t` (short) with accessor method of the same name to fetch it
 * *MUST* be able to construct a `UAuthority` from a string

=== UResource
`UResource` contains the resource id, name, instance, and message portion of the uProtocol uRI.

 * Type name *MUST* be `UResource`
 * *MUST* contain `name`, `instance`, and `message` member variables of type `std::string` with accessor methods of the same name to fetch each
 * *MUST* contain `id` member variable of type `uint16_t` (short) with accessor method of the same name to fetch it
 * *MUST* be able to construct a `UResource` from:
  - String representation of `UResource` per the URI specifications
  - `name` and `instance` only
  - `name` only

=== UriSerializer
`UriSerializer` is the interface that defines the serialize and deserialize methods for the different types of serializers.
There are two implementations of the serializer, they are link:#long_uris[LongUriSerializer] and link:#_micro_uris[MicroUriSerializer] that will be elaborated further in the next section.

== Serialized URIs

=== Long Uris

Long URIs are UUris that have been serialized to a string containing human readable names.

.Long Form URI Description
[#long-form-uri]
[width="100%",cols="23%,18%,59%",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Value |Description

|*SCHEME* |`up:` |Scheme (protocol name)
|*USERINFO* |pchar |User information
|*UDEVICE* |unreserved |Canonical hostname or IP address of the device following https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035[RFC1035] requirements.
|*UDOMAIN* | |Canonical domain name of the device following https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035[RFC1035] requirements.
|*PORT* |uint |The external port that the device streamer is listening on. Default **MAY **be 443
|*UE* |pchar |The name of the uE
|*UE_VERSION* |pchar a|
uE version  section.

If the URI is part of a topic:

* *MUST* only contain the MAJOR version number

|*METHOD* |pchar |Service rpc method name as defined in the service proto file, contains the prefix rpc. before the method name
|*RESOURCE* |pchar |A uThing that can be uniquely identified using a URI and manipulated/controlled by a service. Resources unique scope is when prepended with device and service to become a fully qualified URI. uThings that are not resources may be a service specific features, functionality, capabilities, etcâ€¦
|*MESSAGE* |*( pchar / "/" / "?" ) |Protobuf message name as defined in https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview.
|===


*Additional URI Protocol Rules:*

* *MAY* contain schema
* A segment in the path (UE_NAME, UE_VERSION, RESOURCE, METHOD) *MAY* be empty, resulting in two consecutive slashes (//) in the path component, this is equivalent to a wildcard
* Schema and authority *MUST* be case-insensitive per RFC3986
* Path, query, and message *MUST* be case-sensitive

If a segment in the path is empty:

* The path *MUST NOT* start with "//"
* Path *MUST* be https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.3[path-abempty] (i.e. its value can be either an absolute path or empty)

NOTE: Local URIs do not contain the authority and begin with `/` (forward slash)



=== Micro Uris
Micro URIs are used to represent various portions of the URI in byte array format using only the IDs for various portions of UAuthority, UEntity, and UResource. Micro URIs may be used in the uProtocol transport layer (uP-L1) to reduce the size of the URI and improve performance. There are two types of Micro URIs, they are local and remote where remote contains an address (IP or ID) and local is without an address (refer to some uThing that is local to the device).

* All fields of micro UUri *MUST* be populated
* Fields are Big-Endian unless otherwise specified

== Wildcards
wildcard are used to replace portions of the URI to perform pattern matching (i.e. subscribing to multiple topics, searching for services, etc...). Wildcard is is represented in a long or short URI only when the segment is blank.

NOTE: Not all uPlatforms and uEs support wildcards, please refer to the uPlatform and uE documentation for more information.


== Example URIs

The section will give a few example URIs and their use in uProtocol. Service and resource will be generalized in this section. Example devices used for reference are http://bo.up.gm.com[bo.up.gm.com] representing the back office device, and VIN representing a vehicle.

NOTE: To illustrate the different URI formats, we will use uSubscription service definitions and IDs found in https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-core-api/blob/main/src/main/proto/core/usubscription/v2/usubscription.proto[usubscription.proto]. 

NOTE: Remote examples below shall assumed the device names have already been resolved to IP addresses

== Best Practices

As mentioned above, UUri is the datamodel that represents the uProtocol URI in object form per programming language where as Long and Micro Uris are serialized representations of the UUri object to be used (sent) between uEs, devices, etc... 

uProtocol URI specifications complies with of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986[RFC3986] that builds https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034[DNS concepts and facilities] to allow representation of UAuthorty as names or addresses. 

A resolved UUri is one that contains both the Long and Micro Uri information meaning both the names and IDs such that the UUri can be serialized to either a string (long) or byte[] (micro) format. When a UUri is not resolved (only contain either names or ids), the only way to resolve the UUri is to lookup in uDiscovery the missing information. UEntity names and numbers are embedded encoded into the service definitions (proto files) using  https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto2/#options[Options], and the UResource information is included in https://protobuf.dev/reference/csharp/api-docs/class/google/protobuf/reflection/message-descriptor[MessageDescriptors], this means that Application layer (uP-L3) uEs (client and servers) have available the ability to populate fully resolved UUris (at least UEntity & UResource). 

link:../up-l2/README.adoc[Dispatchers] however do not have the name-to-number mapping metadata as they are only provided either serialized Long or Micro Uris so if they have to send a Uri in a different format, they have no choice but to dynamically lookup (resolve) the Uri. 


IMPORTANT: If a uE has a specific Uri format requirements (Long vs Micro), they *MUST* document them in their respective APIs specifications. Please see link:../up-l3/README.adoc#_core_platform_ues[Core Platform uEs] for more specific requirements for uProtocol core services.

The next sections shall provide best practices for populating and using URIs in uProtocol.

=== Application Layer (uP-L3) uEs
* *MUST* populate both the name and numbers in UEntity & UResource portion of the UUri

If the UUri points to a remote uThing:
* *MUST* contain Resolved UAuthority (domain and address). Where the address could be either IP or a VIN

=== Communication Layer (uP-L2)
* Streamers MUST populate/res
=== uTransports (uP-L1)

* Applications that call uTransport::send() *MUST* be passed resolved UUris if either names or numbers are missing, uTransport must return INVALID_PARAMETER
* Returned UUris from uTransport *MAY* contain only numbers (or names) and as such the application *MAY* resolve the missing information using a resolve() API provided by the language specific SDKs
* *MUST* use the Miro Uri serialization format "on the wire"
* *MAY* send fully resolved UUris (names and numbers) 

* *SHOULD* use Micro Uris when at all possible
